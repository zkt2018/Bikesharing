# **Bikesharing**
## **Overview of the analysis**
In this project, using Tableau visualization tool, we created different graphs and charts to analyse the dataset. The *201908-citibike-tripdata* contains the data of bike riders of New York City in August 2019. By creating charts and graphs in Tableau, we are providing a visual analysis to present to the investors for the Des Moines bike sharing project. Through Tableau tools, we have filtered and organized different components of the dataset to get an idea for our investment.
## **Results**
Tableau provides different tools for data analysis visualization. Each worksheet can display a specific graph or chart. By adding the worksheets on a dashboard, we are not only able to monitor the changes, but also explore the data from different aspects.
Here are some examples of the created charts and a brief description of each:
1. Visualizing the number of records on a bar chart at the beginning revealed interesting information regarding the peak hours of bike riding. As shown in the bar chart below, bike riding has been more frequent during the rush hours in the morning at about 8-9AM as well as evening at about 5-6PM.

2. Top Starting Location demonstrates the bike stops that have been more popular as a starting point. This map shows different size and color of cycles depending on the popularity of the location.

3. One of the costs of a bike sharing business would be the maintenance of the bikes. The bubble chart below shows how often each bike has been used. The more a bike is used, the more possible it needs service.

4. Based on the records in the August 2019 dataset, most of the bike riders during this month have been Male customers.

5. The following map combines the gender breakdown with the frequency of the rides during week days and hours.

6. NYC Citi Bike Dashboard represents a number of different graphs on one page. This is to facilitate the analysis of data using different graphs. Dashboards can be updated automatically when the original chart is updated.

7. Tableau stories are good visualization to present different graphs along with a brief description for each. The story we have created for *NYC Citi Bike Analysis* shows one of the heatmap charts in the image below.

## **Summary**
Tableau provides a platform to interactively represent data analysis. In this project, we used New York City dataset to get an idea for investing in a similar project in another city, Des Moines. The visualizations assisted us with knowing what must be considered before investment. Some of the visualizations that have been created during this project are available on Tableau Public via the following links:

[NYC Citi Bike Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ziba7235/viz/NYCCitiBike_16229878691860/NYCCitiBikeStory)

In addition to these visualizations, we can create even more interactive graphs for our data analysis. For instance, the relativity of the age of the customers with subscriptions (Usertype vs. Birth Year). Or, if certain bikes have been used by certain customers, filtering based on the age or gender.
